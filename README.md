Data Structures final assignment

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

The problem I was solving in this course was trying to get a list of courses brought into a system from a CSV file and manipulating that data into usable organized coureses. I chose to make a data structure that used strings for courseID, and course name. Then I tried using a vector for prerequesites and I was unsuccessful, so I used strings for the Prereqs. I had already written pseudocode for this assignment in a previous assignment which helped me a bit. I feel that I have improved with my code commenting and overall made great progress this term.
